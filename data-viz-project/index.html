    <h1>Kori Edmondson's Regular Season Freshman Campaign</h1>
    <h3>By Alexa Wootten</h3>
    <p>Kori Edmondson was voted the No. 1 incoming recruit for the class of 2023 by Inside Lacrosse. Edmondson already had a stellar reputation but her freshman campaign for the Terrapins has only showed how talented the young athlete is. Edmondson has 34 goals on the season and 16 draw controls. Her ability to constantly gain possession for Maryland on the circle, and her insane ability to find the back of the net has made her one of Maryland's newest and biggest assets this season.</p>
