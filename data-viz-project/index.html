    <h1>Kori Edmondson's Regular Season Freshman Campaign</h1>
    <h3>By Alexa Wootten</h3>
    <p>Kori Edomondson was the voted the No. 1 incomong recruit for the class of 2023 by Inside Lacrosse. Edmondson already had a stellar repuation but her freshman campaign for teh the Terrapin's has only showned how talent the young athlete is. Edmondson has 34 goals on the season and 16 draw controls. Her ability to be an assest on the circle and gain possesion for Maryland, and her insane ability to find back of the net has made her one of Maryland newsest and biggest assests this season.</p>
